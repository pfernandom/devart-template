## Description
An art creation is composed of the experiences of the artist: All the present and past feelings, all the places, all the music listened, all the movies watched, other people, current events. All that information gets mixed by an unknown algorithm and it results in the creation of a piece of art.
My application will take information will take some of that information and will create one song. One simple song as a result of who we in the exact moment the song is created. That song will have to fit to the minimum criteria needed to be considered music. That song, just like one composed by a human, will have to be almost unique; a snapshot representing the user in that specific moment.
