#Scales

I remember back in high school I used to play guitar a lot more than I do now. I never learned the full music theory but one thing I do remember: Scales can be used to improvise.
No matter if you don’t have deep music knowledge, if you take the list of notes given in a music scale, and play only the notes given in that scale, the sound makes sense. It might not be a masterpiece but it has harmony.

So, I take the user’s information, and based on it the application selects a rhythm, a music key, the tempo, a set of instruments , a scale for each instrument, and a set of notes per instrument that are contained in their corresponding scales. And that should result in a song.

This is the main function from the class MusicComposerImpl.java that controls the general flow of the song generation:

```
public File createSong(UserProfile profile, String path) {
		File song = new File(path);
		Note key = selectKey(profile);
		Note bassKey = selectBassKey(profile);
		Scale scale = selectScale(profile, key);
		Scale bassScale = selectScale(profile, bassKey);
		
		Composition util = new Composition();
		int tempo = selectTempo(profile);
		InstrumentChannel channel1 = new InstrumentChannel(tempo, Instrument.PIANO, 0);
		InstrumentChannel channel2 = new InstrumentChannel(tempo, Instrument.ACOUSTIC_BASS, 1);

		channel1.setNotes(createNotes(scale,50));
		channel2.setNotes(createNotes(bassScale,50));
	
		util.addChannel(channel1);
		util.addChannel(channel2);
		
		PercussionChannel percussion = new PercussionChannel();
		percussion.setDefaultRythm();
		percussion.setTempo(60);
		util.setPercussion(percussion);
		
		
		Pattern pattern = util.getPattern();
		
		System.err.println(pattern.getMusicString());
		Player player = new Player();
		
		player.play(pattern);
		try {
			player.saveMidi(pattern, song);
		} catch (IOException e) {
			//The midi file couldn't be saved
			song = null;
		}
		
		return song;
	}
```

Until this moment, the method is generating music using random parameters, and a sample can be heard in here:
[FirstRandomGenerated-60BPM-Cmaj-PianoBassAndPercussion.mid] (../project_sounds/FirstRandomGenerated-60BPM-Cmaj-PianoBassAndPercussion.mid)


Now, for this first prototype, I just need to transform user's data (in the object UserProfile) instead of using random and fixated values.
