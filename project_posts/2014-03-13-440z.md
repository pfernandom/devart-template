#440Hz

*“11:15, restate my assumptions: 1. Mathematics is the language of nature. 2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers.”* **[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt](Maximillian Cohen - Pi (1998))**

Can art be expressed through numbers?

Let’s say it does. In order to back up this affirmation we need to demonstrate that there is an algorithm that can be used to produce art; a set of defined operations that we can apply to something and produce a result that might fit in our current standards for art.

I want to try get close to an answer.
