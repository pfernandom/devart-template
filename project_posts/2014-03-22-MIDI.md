#Scales

I remember back in high school I used to play guitar a lot more than I do now. I never learned the full music theory but one thing I do remember: Scales can be used to improvise.
No matter if you don’t have deep music knowledge, if you take the list of notes given in a music scale, and play only the notes given in that scale, the sound makes sense. It might not be a masterpiece but it has harmony.

So, I take the user’s information, and based on it the application selects a rhythm, a music key, the tempo, a set of instruments , a scale for each instrument, and a set of notes per instrument that are contained in their corresponding scales. And that should result in a song.

Thanks to [Tom Michero](http://www.guitar-chord-theory.com) and his site of music theory applied to guitar, because he has in there a list of many different scales.

A scale is just a pattern (again with the Math) of steps between notes. Change the number of steps you do from note to note and you change from scale. Even little changes can give you different sounds. So basically you start from any note, take the number of steps indicated by the scale and you have a list of possible notes.

So, now on the code...

This is the main function from the class MusicComposerImpl.java that controls the general flow of the song generation:

```
public File createSong(UserProfile profile, String path) {
		File song = new File(path);
		Note key = selectKey(profile);
		Note bassKey = selectBassKey(profile);
		Scale scale = selectScale(profile, key);
		Scale bassScale = selectScale(profile, bassKey);
		
		Composition util = new Composition();
		int tempo = selectTempo(profile);
		InstrumentChannel channel1 = new InstrumentChannel(tempo, Instrument.PIANO, 0);
		InstrumentChannel channel2 = new InstrumentChannel(tempo, Instrument.ACOUSTIC_BASS, 1);

		channel1.setNotes(createNotes(scale,50));
		channel2.setNotes(createNotes(bassScale,50));
	
		util.addChannel(channel1);
		util.addChannel(channel2);
		
		PercussionChannel percussion = new PercussionChannel();
		percussion.setDefaultRythm();
		percussion.setTempo(60);
		util.setPercussion(percussion);
		
		
		Pattern pattern = util.getPattern();
		
		System.err.println(pattern.getMusicString());
		Player player = new Player();
		
		player.play(pattern);
		try {
			player.saveMidi(pattern, song);
		} catch (IOException e) {
			//The midi file couldn't be saved
			song = null;
		}
		
		return song;
	}
```

Until this moment, the method is generating music using random parameters, and a sample can be heard in here:
[FirstRandomGenerated-60BPM-Cmaj-PianoBassAndPercussion.mid](../project_sounds/FirstRandomGenerated-60BPM-Cmaj-PianoBassAndPercussion.mid)


Now, to end this first part of the prototype, I just need to transform the user's data (in the object UserProfile) instead of using random and fixated values.
